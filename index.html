        <p>
          I attended Gorman Learning Center and graduated with a 4.0 GPA as well as Honors.  Throughout my middle and
          high school years, I took part in various volunteer activities such as assisting in the care of horses at Bella Vista Ranch, reading to 
          the residents of the Highland Care Center of Redlands, and aiding in the renovation/construction of the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses.
          I love working as part of a team and collaborating with others to solve problems that arise. My goal is to give back to my 
          community in any way I can as a thank you to all those including teachers and mentors, that have helped me become the person I am today.
